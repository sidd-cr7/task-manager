```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# Data Source

Tasks are stored and managed using local React component state.  
No external APIs, backend services, or databases are used, as the goal of this project is to demonstrate frontend state management, UI clarity, and user interactions.

---

# Assumptions

- The application is intended for single-user usage
- No authentication or user accounts are required
- Task data is not persisted and will reset on page refresh
- The focus of the assignment is frontend logic and UI/UX rather than backend integration.
